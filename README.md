## Getting Started

1. Install Rails at the command prompt:
```
        $ gem install rails
```
2. To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:
```
        $ bundle install --without production
```

3. Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

4. Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

5. If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
